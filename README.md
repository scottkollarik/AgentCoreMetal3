# Agentic AI Starter Kit
**Build. Extend. Orchestrate.**  
The easiest way to kickstart modular, scalable Agentic AI projects.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Agentic AI is the future — autonomous agents that can plan, reason, act, and collaborate.

But getting started often feels overwhelming.

The **Agentic AI Starter Kit** gives you a clean, extensible foundation where:
- Agents, tools, protocols, memory, and workflows are **modular and pluggable**
- New capabilities can be added without rewriting the core
- Configurations are managed cleanly through YAML
- Industry patterns like MCP, A2A, LangGraph orchestration are supported

Whether you're a beginner experimenting or a builder preparing production-grade systems — this starter kit accelerates your journey.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Agents** | Modular agents (PlanningAgent, ExecutionAgent, MonitoringAgent) |
| **Protocols** | Communication logic (MCP, A2A) |
| **Tools** | Web Search, Summarization, Database Query |
| **Memory** | Short-term memory, Vector memory |
| **Workflows** | Sequential and parallel task execution |
| **Orchestrators** | Flexible orchestration styles |
| **Config-Driven** | Easily swap agents, tools, protocols with no code change |

---

## 🛠️ How to Extend

- Add a new Agent → Create a class under `/agents/` inheriting from `BaseAgent`
- Add a new Tool → Drop a new file under `/tools/`
- Add a new Protocol → Extend `/protocols/`
- Create custom workflows → Use `/workflows/`
- Customize orchestration → Swap orchestrators in `/orchestrators/`

---

## 📈 Roadmap (Coming Soon)

- Multi-memory management
- Advanced agent planning modules
- Full GUI for workflow building
- Cloud-native deployment templates (AWS, GCP, Azure)
